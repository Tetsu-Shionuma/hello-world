# hello-world

Hi Everyone.

I'm a DJ, writer, engineer and sometimes an actor. Tokyo based Japanese.
I love DJing, writing novels, acting, and some outdoor activities such as climbing, camping, etc.

I've just started programming. (February 3, 2019)

If you feel something interested in me, please keep your eyes on what I'm doing here.

Thank you for reading! :)
